# ES6 Boilerplate
This is the base project I use when I want to quickly start a project/POC.

###NPM scripts
- `npm run build` -> build the app
- `npm run lint` -> lint your code
- `npm start` -> fire up devserver in port 8080
- `npm t / npm test` -> run tests using AVA
- `npm run cover` -> code coverage
- `cover:check` -> check coverage (set to a 90% minimum)
- `npm run watch:test` -> watch tests
- `npm run watch:cover` -> watch coverage
- `npm run depoly` -> Deploy your project to gh-pages

### Note about Installation
I'm using shrinkpack to manage deps in the project.
- **To Install/Update new deps:**
`npm i -S your-dep && npm run deps` / `npm i -D your-dep && npm run deps`


### Sidenote
This could be too opinionated for your needs. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
